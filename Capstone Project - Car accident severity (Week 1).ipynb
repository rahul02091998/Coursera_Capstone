    "There is a huge impact on the society due to traffic accidents where there is a great costs of fatalities and injuries. In recent years, there is a increase in the researches attention to determine the significantly affect the severity of the drivers injuries which is caused due to the road accidents.\n",
    "Accurate and comprehensive accident records are the basis of accident analysis. the effective use of accident records depends on some factors, like the accuracy of the data, record retention, and dala analysis. There is many approaches applied to Lo this scenario tO study this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recent study illustrated that residential and shopping sites are more hazardous than village areas.as might have been predicted the frequencies of the casualties were higher near the zones of residence possibly because of the higher exposure. A study revealed that the casualty rates among the residential areas are classified as relatively deprived and significantly higher than those from relatively affluent areas.accidents have become very common these days. Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year, on average, 3,287 deaths a day. Moreover, 20-50 million people are injured or disabled annually. Road trafific crashes rank as the 9th leading cause of death and accounts for 2.2% of all deaths globally. In this contest u better severity of the accidents machine learning and neural techniques has been us ed analysis.These techniques helpful to better accident severity.\n",
